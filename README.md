# Scrapy-Project--DataMining
A part from the original project developed for a time ago. It is scraping a website and extracts the data which is stored in a .json file. To execute the script run : scrapy crawl myspider -a source="pagejaunes" -a entity="[the filed you want to get, ex: macon]" -a area="[the area you want to search from, ex: Bordeaux]" -o data.json
